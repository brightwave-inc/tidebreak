//! The storage seams every client sits on.
//!
//! Three traits, deliberately backend-agnostic so a profile can wire different
//! implementations without touching callers:
//!
//! - [`Store`] — durable metadata/state (chats, messages, settings). The
//!   default impl is SQLite; the same trait maps to Postgres for self-host.
//! - [`SecretProvider`] — credentials (model API keys, connection tokens). These
//!   live in the OS keychain (desktop) or a KMS/Vault (server) and are **never**
//!   written to the [`Store`]; the store only holds opaque secret references.
//! - [`BlobStore`] — bytes (documents, images, exports), served locally or from
//!   object storage.
//!
//! Only the entities that exist today are modeled here. Persistence for
//! connections, documents, and skills is added alongside the slices that
//! introduce those record types.
